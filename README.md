##Disclaimer
If the script does not run as intended, it is most likely due to one or more of the following reasons:

EC2 Instance Configuration: The script is designed to run on an AWS EC2 instance. Ensure that the instance is properly set up with the required specifications.

Administrative Privileges: The script requires sudo privileges to execute certain commands. Make sure your user account has the necessary permissions.

Missing Resources: Some required image files have been intentionally excluded from this repository for anonymity. These files need to be manually added as specified in the script.

OpenAI API Key: The script relies on access to the OpenAI API, which requires a valid API key. Make sure to add your OpenAI API key in the appropriate configuration file or environment variable.

Please ensure the above requirements are met before running the script.
